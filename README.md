# Soils

An android application which displays the composition of soils of all the regions all over India. This application displays information about soils in two ways - either by selecting a location (selecting a state and then city) or by fetching the current location. This application will be of much use for the farmers who can view the composition and texture of the soils in thier area and then plan their crops accordingly. They can also edit the composition of the soil in the app (the changes will be local to them and does not reflect back on other devices) due to the presence of fertilizers/chemicals to the soil in their area.

1. Potassium
2. Phosphorous
3. Alkali
4. Nitrogen
5. Iron Oxide

The application is available in two languages viz English and Hindi to ensure better reachability.
